In particular, interaction with a party that does not follow caste rules results in becoming an outcast.

Then, he showed that a firm would have zero customers if it chose to violate the caste rules, because the gain in utility for customers from the lower prices would be offset by the loss in utility for customers by becoming an outcast.

","The purpose is to show that even if the overall setup is sub-optimal for many of the parties involved, no individual has an incentive to independently stray from the rules.

This is important because the basic premise for the Caste Equilibrium is that at the individual level, members of each caste can only perform that specific task or they will be outcast. Furthermore, this upholds the assumptions made early in the paper that states that a laborer can only produce 1 type of good, markets are competitive, and that each individual has tastes for more than 1 type of good. This creates a reliance on the caste structure that makes it impossible for one person to break equilibrium and ""perform"" at above equilibrium levels when not adhering to the caste expectations.","As explained in my previous answer, Caste-class equilibrium makes it such that one individual by themselves cannot act outside the expectations of their caste-class to achieve better than equilibrium levels of benefit. This is because caste-class determines what kind of work you are eligible to do and what goods you are able to produce. An assumption is that each laborer can only produce one type of good but has tastes for other goods as well. This creates a cycle of dependence on the others in the caste-class to produce their goods for trade. However, if a person breaks out of their caste-class expectations they will be exiled and unable to participate in this trade. Thus a large enough group of people with diversified skills will have to opt out of this caste system in order to break the caste-class equilibrium. 

This principle can be applied to any social structure in which placement in the social structure determines the kind of work one can do.","This is an example of a large enough group that operated outside of the caste-class equilibrium that allowed social hierarchical rules to be lightened.

he shows that where consumers have symmetric information (that is group 2 has the same information as group 1) they purchase more cars n so long as trivial conditions are met

the intuition here is that the mere existence of lemons crowds out the selling of good cars, since consumers are willing to pay based on the expected value of the car (mu) rather than the actual quality, but non-lemon sellers won't enter the market in sufficient quantity if price is too low

the preferable equilibria is not obtainable without symmetric information, which akerlof here shows formally by constructing a two-party economy w a numerierare (A).","one of them sells the cars and knows the quality of each car

one buys the cars and does not know the quality in one scenario, and does in the other 

this is important b/c it shows how self-sorting into equilibria occurs. car quality here is uniformly distributed in the selling group ","shows how asymmetries in information cause inefficient equilibria to emerge -- this is hugely important for understanding problems like the principle agent problem (shirking), or any other imperfect market. i quite like this paper","same problem -- some ppl over 65 are ""lemons"" and likely to get sick, but this is not observable (and not legal to observe!) by insurance companies

therefore they are not able to give a fair price to them -- that is, the asymmetry here is that insurers can not offer the fair price of insurance (which classically is just the probability of the person getting sick) b/c that is not a known quantity 

like in the market for lemons, insurers then exit that market because they don't have enough info and have some numeriere good (selling insurance to under-65s)",demand for used cars given the price,price of the cars,income of groups 1 and 2,the utility of group 2 is the quantity of the nuemriere good demanded plus 3/2 times the quality of each car summed over the number of cars purchased,numeriere good,quality of car i,summation over number of cars purchased,Session Two,No,Not familiar at all,No,Agree,Slightly difficult,60,"caste systems can create perverse equilibria where outcast-ing prevents social mobility, efficient allocation","constructs a model w/ two castes and an out-caste, where the out-caste can only receive the lowest wage (since lowest productivity and firms pay MPL). 

shows that this causes firms to have their incentives align w those of the caste system -- that is, they will hire according to the castes, rather than trying to break castes and get greater efficiencies. ","D, dominant caste, N, non-dominant case, and an out-group, those that break the caste system and try to get different work

each have different MPL, skilled, unskilled, and scavenging work specifically 

this is the setup for the paper","shows that in equilibrium no firms have incentives to break the caste system -- that is, they can not get efficiency gains by hiring and paying low-caste ppl for their work if it's high-skill work b/c they need to sell at a higher price

this also has to do w/ the fact that they wouldn't b able to find consumers, b/c they would be out-casted too, so they are not willing to pay ","in the caste system economic success by hiring N ppl is punished by out-casting and causing you to receive $\theta_{SC}$. this causes an inefficient equilibrium b/c labor is not properly allocated and incentives against breaking the caste are so large that a critical mass of firms need to be able to do it together

it's a bit of a collective action problem -- similar to these examples",this is the the critical mass of firms needed to cause incentives for breaking the caste system to outweigh punishments ,the critical mass of firms needed to break the caste system,"right side are the productivities/MPL of workers unskilled, skilled, and scavengers. he reaches this expression through looking at the incentives of diff individuals w/in groups ","b/c \theta_SC is the scavenger/outcaste MPL, it must be the outcaste wage, by definition (very simple firm stuff, like definition of MPL, i am assuming we both already know)

we know that if they bid higher they must take higher MPL but that can only exist w/in D or N groups, as before",ALPHA1,Male,,2022,applied mathematics / economics,,240,150,"i skim a lot of papers, i try not to get bogged down in the math so much

That is, he outlined what it would be like to create outcasts in the system and sustain its workers. This was possible, but came at a cost to the company/producer?","Skilled - workers higher in the caste system
Unskilled - workers lower in the caste system
Scavenger - workers at the very bottom?

They represented different forms of labor which had different outputs and products of labor. ","I think this section was to explain why a caste-class system works, despite it not being advantageous to some groups.
